    introduction: 'Celer Network is a leading layer 2 scaling platform that enables fast, ease and secure off-chain transactions for not only payment transitions, but also generalized off-chain smart contract. Founded by four PhDs from MIT, Princeton, UC Berkeley and UIUC, the network enables everyone to quickly build, operate, and use hightly scalable decentralized applications through innovations in off-chain scaling techniques and incentive-aligned criptoeconomics mechanizm design. Celler Network is on a mission to fully unleach the power of blockchain and revolutionize how decentralized aplications are built and used.',
