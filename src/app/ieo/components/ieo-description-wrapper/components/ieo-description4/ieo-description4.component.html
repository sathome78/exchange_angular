      <h4>CONCLUSIONS</h4>
      <p>The E-Tao project has ambitious goals:</p>

      <p>- fully implement the concept of cryptocurrency liquidity by exchanging any token for everyday goods;
        <br>- increase the involvement of the audience in the field of cryptocurrency by several times;
        <br>- to accelerate the growth rate of the cryptocurrency market;
        <br>- to revolutionize the world of e-commerce by shifting the mindset of users from the fiat model to the cryptocurrency model of the economy.
      </p>
      <p> The benefits of the E-Tao platform for retailers and customers are clear and significant.
        <br>That’s why we are - with a high degree of confidence - predict that this project will be commercially successful and promising.
        <br>The further development of the project will also stimulate the volatility of the majority of alternative cryptocurrencies, mitigate market
        volatility and - globally - increase interest in the cryptographic industry as a whole.
        <br>The world today is irreversibly and rapidly changing. As the crypto industry also grows rapidly with the world, it will take some time and some - if
        not all - of today's e-commerce giants will realize the need to integrate structural modules into their platforms to guarantee payment in the
        cryptocurrency.
        <br>When that time comes, E-Tao will confidently occupy a significant part of this promising commercial niche.
        <br>You can simply observe the changes taking place and do nothing, but you can change the world with us, working for the common progress and prosperity
        of humanity as a whole. That’s why we need your support of the E-Tao Project!
